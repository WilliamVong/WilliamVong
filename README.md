* I did some spring cleaning in my Repositories list, it should be cut from 71 to 37 repos.
## About Me

Hello! I'm a computer-science loving student at Stuyvesant High School. I program primarily in Node.js for most of my Discord bots and miscellaneous projects and junk, and also know:
* `[=================>     ]` Python
* `[==============>        ]` Java
* `[==============>        ]` HTML/CSS/JS and web design
* `[============>          ]` Julia
* `[==========>            ]` Bash (scripting)

## Projects

My biggest project is [**MCYT**](https://mcyt.social). It's a Discord bot that happens to do stuff that MCYT fans do too.  
I also work on other web design projects, for example you can see [Stuy.world](https://stuy.world).
